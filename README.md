# A GitHub action for building a Writerside docs artifacts in a Docker container

This action creates a zip-archive with HTMLs from markdown or semantic markup topics.

## Environment variables

You need to change these variables values to the ones from your help project.

### `ARTIFACT`

The name of the archive is webHelpXX2-all.zip where XX gets replaced by the instance id in caps.

For example, if the help instance is *Foo Help*, and its ID is `fh`, then set `ARTIFACT: webHelpFH2-all.zip`.

### `PRODUCT`

The name of the help module and help instance ID separated by a slash. 

When you create a new Writerside project or a help instance in an existing project,
the default help module name is `Writerside` and the default instance id is `hi`. 
So, in this case, set `PRODUCT: Writerside/hi`.
